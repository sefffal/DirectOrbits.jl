You can create fully or partially symbolic KeplerianElements and/or solve for orbits at a time or true anomaly given by a symbolic t. This could come in use in a few scenarios. For example, if you have an orbit with all parameters known except inclination, you could construct a set of elements with i as a symbolic variable. Solving the orbit using orbitsolve would then return a solution with simplified symbolic expressions of i that can be evaluated very efficiently for different values. N.B. this approach is quite messy for a symbolic e since Kepler's equation is trancendental.","category":"page"},{"location":"symbolics/","page":"Symbolic Manipulation","title":"Symbolic Manipulation","text":"There is some support for using the Symbolics.jl package.
